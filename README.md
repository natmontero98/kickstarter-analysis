# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to disciver trends. Bootcamp-Module 1 
## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to help Louise make an informed decision to create her own successful crowdfunding campaign for her play. To help her, we'll analyse the trends and results in a dataset of thousands of different campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For Outcomes based on launch date we created a pivot table and a pivot chart, in which the outcomes were filtered based on the "theater" parent category. Our pivot table and chart allows us to visualize all the possible outcomes (successful, live, canceled and failed) by month and year. Filtering and organizing the data in this way helps us determine if the launch date of the campaign had a significant influence in its outcome. 
With this analysis we found that the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. We also found though that the months of January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.
No challenges presented while doing this analysis. In this case a line chart was perfect to visualize trends, but it could be a challenge to decide which type of chart tells the story we want to tell in the best way possible. Also, determining the right factors to filter in a pivot table (and its arrangement in the table) might not be so obvious. Theres a lot of playing around and trying different things when it comes to pivot tables and charts. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
