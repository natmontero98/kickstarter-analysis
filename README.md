Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to discover trends. Bootcamp-Module 1
## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to help Louise make an informed decision to create her own successful crowdfunding campaign for her play. To help her, we'll analyse the trends and results in a dataset of thousands of different campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For Outcomes based on launch date, we created a pivot table and a pivot chart, in which the outcomes were filtered based on the "theater" parent category. Our pivot table and chart allow us to visualize all the possible outcomes (successful, live, canceled, and failed) by month and year. Filtering and organizing the data helps us determine if the campaign's launch date had a significant influence on its outcome.
With this analysis, we found that the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May and June. We also found though, that May, June, July, and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The most successful campaigns were the ones with goals within the ranges of less than $1000 and $1000 - $4999, which were the lowest. This makes sense, given that it is easier to reach a lower goal. In this range, 75% of the campaigns, on average were successful. Nonetheless, it is important to notice that the ranges of $35,000 to $39,999 and $40,000 to $44,999 had a high success rate as well (67%), so it might be ideal to analyze in more detail the specific campaigns to know what made them successful even at a higher goal. This is important because, according to the data presented, non of the campaigns within the range of $45,000 to $49,999 were successful.
Despite the exceptions mentioned previously, the graph shows that, as the goal increases, the success rates tends to decrease.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While doing the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" analysis, we found that the months with more successful campaigns were also the months with more failed campaigns. This is a challenge for the analysis because it's hard to draw a conclusion of what is the best month to launch. Further analysis should be done to determine success and failure rates. It could be a challenge to decide which type of chart tells the story we want to tell in the best way possible. Also, determining the right factors to filter in a pivot table (and its arrangement in the table) might not be so obvious. There's a lot of playing around and trying different things when it comes to pivot tables and graphs. 

On the other hand, the analysis of "Outcomes Based on Goals" does present a few challenges. We have an evident trend in the data but analyzing the ranges that seem to go against the general trend will take some extra time, but it is something that should be done to get the best understanding of why certain campaigns are successful even when their goals are some of the highest in the dataset.

## Results

- Two conclusions we can draw about the Outcomes Based on Launch Date analysis are that May and June are potentially good months to start a campaign because they showed the highest number of successful campaigns, but as mentioned previously, further analysis should be done to determine what is making the campaigns successful, given that failed campaigns were also high for these months. Looking at the data, we can also conclude that Louise should avoid launching her campaign in October.
- For the Outcomes Based on Goals Analysis, the conclusion is that as the goal set for the campaign increases, the success rates tend to decrease, but there seem to be some exceptions to the rule so we should analyze the specific campaigns to figure out the factor that improved their success.
- Some limitations of this dataset are that it doesn't include detailed information about how the campaign was promoted. We lack some qualitative information to know what exactly makes a campaign successful.

- Some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create:
  - Outcomes Based on Country 
  - Outcomes Based on Subcategory and Category 
  - Outcomes Based on Launch Date (percentage for each outcome)
